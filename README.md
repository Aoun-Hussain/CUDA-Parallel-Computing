This project consists of the cuda source file which takes 4 arguments -N following number of dimensions and -I following total iterations and executes the laplace equations using jacobian iterations to update the temperature of the square plate. Writes the output temperature coordinates to
the csv file and output the total execution time. Uses CUDA and multi-threaded GPUS for the purpose.
